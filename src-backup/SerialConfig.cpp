/**
 * \example SerialConfig.cpp
 *
 * PolySync Serial Configuration C++ API example application
 * 
 *      Demonstrate the configuration of the serial port for cases where the
 *      connection is using something other than no flow control, no parity,
 *      8 data bits, and 1 stop bit
 *      
 *      To exercise this example requires two serial ports, they can be on the
 *      same computer.  One of the serial ports is used by this application;
 *      this application sets the serial port to a 7E2 configuration.  The
 *      other serial port should be configured the same way.  The user can then
 *      send strings over the serial port until they send "quit" at which point
 *      the application will exit.
 *      
 *      Both serial ports must be capable of running at 7 Data bits, 2 Stop
 *      bits with even parity and support RTS/CTS hardware flow control.
